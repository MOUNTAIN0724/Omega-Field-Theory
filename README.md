# Omega-Field-Theory-
Ω Field Theory: A novel framework explaining cosmic acceleration and cluster dynamics through spacetime elasticity. Challenging ΛCDM with testable "silver bullet" predictions.

Ω場理論：通過時空彈性解釋宇宙加速和星系團動力學的新框架。用可檢驗的「銀子彈」預言挑戰ΛCDM模型。

# Ω Field Theory: Cosmic Elasticity Framework

## 🎯 The Silver Bullet Prediction
**In galaxy clusters with M > 10¹⁵M☉, the velocity dispersion index will decrease from α=0.33 to α=0.28**

## 🌟 Core Concept
Ω field introduces "spacetime elasticity" that:
- Drives cosmic acceleration without dark energy
- Modifies cluster dynamics predictably
- Provides testable alternatives to ΛCDM

## 🚀 Quick Start
```python
# Install and test
pip install -r requirements.txt
python tests/basic_validation.py

# Run example simulation
python examples/cluster_velocity_field.py
